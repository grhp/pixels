This test draws a small set of single-pixel thick lines onto a 2D canvas. It draws vertical lines
into the left-most pixel column, the 101st column, and the right-most column. The right-most column
is what's tricky! It also does the same thing for the vertical axis.

Because the test uses integer coordinates, it uses "translate" to apply an offset by a half-pixel,
otherwise the lines appear thicker than intended.

It is interesting to note that the following formula for determining physical width results in a
non-integer value on some mobile devices:

    canvas.clientWidth * window.devicePixelRatio

This results in subtle blurring around the lines, and right-most / bottom-most lines go missing.
